"Add New Non-ITIS node" INTERFACE:
Please replace text as follows:
>>
Each node (i.e. species) that is not already in the ITIS database receives a Non-ITIS id with which is identified in our local database.  Each Non-ITIS id must point to a valid ITIS id at some higher (parent) taxonomic level.  If your new node's parent is already in ITIS, this will be a simple three-step process: (1) Use the "Parent Search" field to search the ITIS database for the scientific name of the most specific taxonomic name you can identify your new node to. Then (2) manually enter the taxonomic level and the Latin name of your new node.  Then (3) specify (i) a representative "working name" for the nod, (ii) select its functional group, and (iii) check "is assemblage" if the entry does not represent a node that is identified to the species-specific level.

The working name should represent an easily recognizable synonym for the node.  Most often, this will be the common name (e.g. Latin name: Enhydra lultris, Working name: Sea otter).

Note: If you have multiple taxonomic levels that are not already in ITIS, you will need to repeat the above steps several times, starting with the level of the parent that is already in ITIS. From there, work your way down by using the "Parent Search" field to search for the either an ITIS node or Non-ITIS node that represents the next parent.
<<

Additional notes (* please add text field at bottom of interface*) - Further information on node (e.g. if a single node is suspected of being a cryptic species complex).
